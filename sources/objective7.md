Instead of having a prechallenge, you get hints if you complete [Objective 6](obj6)
```{hint}
1. Files placed in */app/lib/public/incoming* will be accessible under https://printer.kringlecastle.com/incoming/.
2. When analyzing a device, it's always a good idea to pick apart the firmware. Sometimes these things come down Base64-encoded.
3. [Hash Extension Attacks](https://blog.skullsecurity.org/2012/everything-you-need-to-know-about-hash-length-extension-attacks) can be super handy when there's some type of validation to be circumvented.
