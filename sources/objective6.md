```{hint}
1. If you run into any shellcode primers at the North Pole, be sure to read the directions and the comments in the shellcode source!
2. Lastly, be careful not to overwrite any register values you need to reference later on in your shellcode.
3. Also, troubleshooting shellcode can be difficult. Use the debugger step-by-step feature to watch values.
