If you complete the prechallenge, you will gain access to these little tips.
```{hint}
1. When sending a [POST request with data](https://www.educative.io/edpresso/how-to-perform-a-post-request-using-curl), add `--data-binary` to your curl command followed by the data you want to send.
2. [cURL](https://linux.die.net/man/1/curl) makes HTTP requests from a terminal - in Mac, Linux, and modern Windows!
3. The [iwlist](https://linux.die.net/man/8/iwlist) and [iwconfig](https://linux.die.net/man/8/iwconfig) utilities are key for managing Wi-Fi from the Linux command line.
