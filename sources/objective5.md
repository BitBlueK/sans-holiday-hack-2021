1. It's also possible the reverse engineer encoded Ducky Script using [Mallard](https://github.com/dagonis/Mallard).
2. The [MITRE ATT&CKâ„¢ tactic T1098.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1098/004/) describes SSH persistence techniques through authorized keys files.
3. Attackers can encode Ducky Script using a [duck encoder](https://docs.hak5.org/hc/en-us/articles/360010471234-Writing-your-first-USB-Rubber-Ducky-Payload) for delivery as `inject.bin`.
4. [**Ducky Script**](https://docs.hak5.org/hc/en-us/articles/360010555153-Ducky-Script-the-USB-Rubber-Ducky-language) is the language for the USB Rubber Ducky.
