FPGA Programming - Prechallenge
=======================

Click on the Frostavator, and then on `Open Panel`. <br>

To complete this prechallenge we have to light up the 3 *output* lights at the same time. <br>
We can achive that by switching the tiles, which graphically represent some logic gates. <br>
<br>

<br>

* **AND:** The bottom LED lights up if the **TWO** upper LEDs are **ON**
* **NAND:** The bottom LED lights up if **at least ONE** upper LED is **OFF**
* **NOR:** The bottom LED lights up if **no** upper LEDs are **ON**
* **XOR:** The bottom LED lights up if **ONLY ONE** upper LED is **ON**
* **X-NOR:** The bottom LED lights up if **no** upper LED is **ON**, or if **TWO** upper LEDs are **ON**

There are various ways to solve this challenge. <br>
When you manage to complete the circuit, you will see an "Online!" message.
