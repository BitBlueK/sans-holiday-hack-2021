If you manage to bypass the yara rules, you will gain access to these hints
```{hint}
1. Between GitHub audit log and webhook event recording, you can monitor all activity in a repository, including common git commands such as `git add`, `git status`, and `git commit`.
2. Did you know there are multiple versions of the Netcat command that can be used maliciously? `nc.openbsd`, for example.
3. Sysmon network events don't reveal the process parent ID for example. Fortunately, we can pivot with a query to investigate process creation events once you get a process ID.
